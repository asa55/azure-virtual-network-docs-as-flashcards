# azure-vnet-docs-as-flashcards

- This project leverages v2.0.0 of [`md2apkg-run`](https://github.com/asa55/md2apkg-run) to build Anki-compatible flashcard deck out of the `.md` flashcard definition files underneath the `Deck/` folder.
- Tags are automagically applied to the flashcards according to the folder hierarchy.
- The folder hierarchy in this project, and hence the flashcard tags, align with the [Azure VNET documentation here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/)
- Usage notes can be found in the [`md2apkg-run`](https://github.com/asa55/md2apkg-run) project readme.
- When I'm ready to release these notes, I'll put a successful build somewhere convenient and document that decision here. If you're reading this, the flashcards are coming along but I'm not at the point where I'm ready to tag a full release just yet.
- All of the flashcards in this deck are drawn from the official documentation at `learn.microsoft/azure/virtual-network`
  - Not all of the official documentation at `learn.microsoft/azure/virtual-network` is included in these flashcards
  - Project status is located on the project board. Issues are organized in a way that aligns with the Azure official documentation structure
- If you want to help influence what I add next, consider going to the appropriate issue and leaving a :+1: and/or a comment
  - If you really like the project and want to see more, faster, let me know. Once these flashcards reach a minimum level of maturity, I'll consider setting up a dono button or a link to my Patreon
- Lastly, I don't plan on stopping with VNET docs. I'll add more flashcard decks (to other repos on my GitHub account) related to Azure and technologies within and surrounding the .NET ecosystem. Keep an eye out for these
