VNet concepts include

%

- Address space
- Subnets
- Regions
- Subscription

##

When creating a VNet, you must specify a custom private IP address space using

%

public and private (RFC 1918) addresses.

##

Azure assigns resources in a virtual network a private IP address from

%

the address space that you assign.

##

Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to

%

each subnet

##

Just like in a traditional network, subnets allow you to segment your VNet address space into

%

segments that are appropriate for the organization's internal network

##

Address allocation efficiency is improved by

%

subnets

##

You can secure resources within subnets using

%

Network Security Groups (NSGs)

##

VNet is scoped to a single (geographical)

%

region/location

##

Multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected together using 

%

Virtual Network Peering

##

VNet is scoped to a (billing)

%

subscription

##

You can implement multiple virtual networks within each

%

- Azure subscription and
- Azure region
