When creating a VNet, you must specify a custom private IP address space using public and private (RFC **1918**) addresses.

##

Azure assigns resources in a virtual network a private IP address from the address space that 

%

you assign

##

Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to

%

each subnet

##

Just like in a traditional network, subnets allow you to segment your VNet address space into segments that are appropriate for the organization's

%

internal network

##

Subnets improve address allocation

%

efficiency

##

You can secure resources within subnets using

%

Network Security Groups (NSGs)

##

VNet is scoped to a single `_____` and a single `_____`.

%

VNet is scoped to a single **region/location** and a single **subscription**.

##

Multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected together using 

%

Virtual Network Peering

##

You can implement multiple virtual networks within each

- Azure subscription and
- Azure region
